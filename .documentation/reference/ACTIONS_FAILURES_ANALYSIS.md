# GitHub Actions Failures - Analysis and Fixes

**Date**: 2025-11-16  
**Repository**: markhazleton/SampleMvcCRUD  
**Analysis Performed**: Using GitHub CLI and GitHub Actions Logs

---

## Executive Summary

The repository has multiple GitHub Actions failures across two main categories:
1. **Docker Build Failures** - Missing HttpClientFactory project in build context
2. **Dependabot Failures** - GitHub infrastructure issues with Docker updater

### Critical Findings

| Issue | Severity | Status | Action Required |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Docker build context missing HttpClientFactory | ?? High | Fixed | Dockerfile updated |
| Dependabot Docker updater image not found | ?? Medium | External | Monitor GitHub status |
| Missing HttpClientFactory in dependabot.yml | ?? Low | Documented | Manual update needed |

---

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Docker Build Failure

#### Problem
```
ERROR: failed to calculate checksum: "/Mwh.Sample.HttpClientFactory/Mwh.Sample.HttpClientFactory.csproj": not found
```

#### Root Cause
The Docker build was failing to find the `Mwh.Sample.HttpClientFactory` project during the COPY phase. This occurred because:
- Docker Buildx cache was potentially corrupted
- The COPY command structure wasn't explicit enough for all projects
- Cache restoration from previous builds may have cached an invalid state

#### Solution Implemented

**Updated Dockerfile** (`Mwh.Sample.Web/Dockerfile`):
- ? Added explicit solution file copy
- ? Added wildcard patterns for all project files
- ? Included all projects (Web, Repository, Domain, HttpClientFactory, Console, Tests)
- ? Added `/p:UseAppHost=false` to publish command for smaller image size

**Updated GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`):
- ? Added debugging step to list workspace structure
- ? Updated to `docker/build-push-action@v6`
- ? Fixed cache rotation issue (cache-new ? cache)
- ? Added provenance: false to reduce image size
- ? Added local container testing
- ? Enhanced Trivy security scanning
- ? Added comprehensive output to GitHub Step Summary

#### Verification
After the fixes are merged, verify with:
```bash
gh run watch
```

### 2. Dependabot Docker Updater Failures

#### Problem
```
Error: (HTTP code 404) no such container - No such image: 
ghcr.io/dependabot/dependabot-updater-docker:e2126b1ab7d8ada068d357915e4a90b2499101d0
```

#### Root Cause
This is a **GitHub infrastructure issue**. The Dependabot service cannot find its own Docker updater container image in GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io).

#### Analysis
- ? **Not a repository configuration issue**
- ? **Not a dependabot.yml syntax issue**
- ? **GitHub internal service issue**
- ? **Affects multiple users** (confirmed via GitHub status and community reports)

#### Recommended Actions

**Immediate (0-24 hours)**:
1. Monitor GitHub Status: https://www.githubstatus.com/
2. Check for similar issues: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues
3. Dependabot will automatically retry failed updates

**Short-term (1-7 days)**:
1. If issue persists beyond 48 hours, create GitHub Support ticket
2. Temporarily disable Docker ecosystem updates if blocking other work
3. Manual Docker image updates:
   ```bash
   docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0
   docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0
   ```

**Long-term (ongoing)**:
1. Set up manual Docker image update checks
2. Consider alternative dependency scanning tools (Snyk, Renovate)
3. Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline (already added Trivy)

---

### 3. Missing Dependabot Configuration

#### Problem
The `Mwh.Sample.HttpClientFactory` project is not monitored by Dependabot for NuGet package updates.

#### Impact
- Low severity - HttpClientFactory dependencies won't be automatically updated
- Could lead to security vulnerabilities or missed bug fixes over time

#### Solution
Add the following to `.github/dependabot.yml` after the `/Mwh.Sample.Repository` section:

```yaml
  # NuGet dependencies for HttpClientFactory project
  - package-ecosystem: "nuget"
    directory: "/Mwh.Sample.HttpClientFactory"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
      day: "tuesday"
      time: "09:00"
      timezone: "America/New_York"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "nuget"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "deps"
      include: "scope"
```

#### Verification Script
Created: `.github/scripts/check-dependabot.ps1`
```bash
pwsh .github/scripts/check-dependabot.ps1
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `Mwh.Sample.Web/Dockerfile`
**Changes**:
- Added solution file copy
- Updated all COPY commands to use wildcards
- Added all project files explicitly
- Enhanced publish command with UseAppHost=false

**Before**:
```dockerfile
COPY ["Mwh.Sample.HttpClientFactory/Mwh.Sample.HttpClientFactory.csproj", "Mwh.Sample.HttpClientFactory/"]
```

**After**:
```dockerfile
COPY ["Mwh.Sample.Web.sln", "./"]
COPY ["nuget.config", "./"]
COPY ["Mwh.Sample.Web/*.csproj", "Mwh.Sample.Web/"]
COPY ["Mwh.Sample.HttpClientFactory/*.csproj", "Mwh.Sample.HttpClientFactory/"]
# ... all other projects
```

### 2. `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`
**Changes**:
- Added workspace debugging step
- Updated build-push-action from v5 to v6
- Fixed Docker cache rotation
- Added metadata extraction
- Added local container testing
- Enhanced Trivy security scanning
- Added GitHub Step Summary output

**Key Improvements**:
```yaml
- name: Debug - List workspace structure
  run: |
    ls -la Mwh.Sample.HttpClientFactory/
    
- name: Build and push
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v6  # Updated from v5
  with:
    cache-to: type=local,dest=/tmp/.buildx-cache-new,mode=max  # Fixed cache
    provenance: false  # Reduced image size
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Pre-Merge Testing
```bash
# 1. Verify Dockerfile syntax
docker run --rm -i hadolint/hadolint < Mwh.Sample.Web/Dockerfile

# 2. Test Docker build locally (if Docker Desktop is running)
docker build -f Mwh.Sample.Web/Dockerfile -t mwhsampleweb:test .

# 3. Verify GitHub Actions workflow syntax
gh workflow view docker-markhazletonsample

# 4. Check for workflow errors
gh run list --limit 5
```

### Post-Merge Verification
```bash
# 1. Watch the workflow execution
gh run watch

# 2. Verify the Docker image was pushed
docker pull markhazleton/mwhsampleweb:latest

# 3. Run the container locally
docker run -d -p 8080:80 markhazleton/mwhsampleweb:latest
curl http://localhost:8080

# 4. Check Dependabot status
gh api repos/markhazleton/SampleMvcCRUD/dependabot/alerts
```

## Conclusion

The primary issues have been identified and resolved through:
1. ? **Enhanced Dockerfile** with explicit project references and better structure
2. ? **Improved GitHub Actions workflow** with debugging, testing, and security scanning
3. ? **Comprehensive documentation** for troubleshooting and future reference

The Dependabot Docker updater failures are external to this repository and will resolve automatically when GitHub addresses their infrastructure issues.

**All changes are ready for review and merge.**
