## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty). User may specify focus areas (e.g., "focus on security and testing") or specific directories to analyze.

## Goal

Help brownfield projects reverse-engineer a project constitution by analyzing existing source code patterns, identifying implicit conventions, and guiding the user through interactive questions to formalize principles.

This command is designed for teams adopting Spec Kit on **existing codebases** where principles exist implicitly in the code but have never been documented.

## Operating Principles

- **Discovery-first**: Analyze code before asking questions—ground questions in actual patterns found
- **Interactive refinement**: Use targeted questions to validate discoveries and fill gaps
- **Draft output**: Produce a draft constitution for user review, not a final document
- **Respect existing work**: Treat discovered patterns as valuable—the team chose them for reasons

## Execution Steps

### 1. Initialize Discovery Context

Identify the codebase structure:

- Detect primary language(s) and frameworks
- Identify source directories (src/, lib/, app/, etc.)
- Locate test directories and patterns
- Find configuration files (.eslintrc, tsconfig, .editorconfig, etc.)
- Check for existing documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, docs/)
- Look for existing AI instruction files (.github/copilot-instructions.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.)

If `.specify/memory/constitution.md` already exists:
- Warn user: "A constitution already exists. This will create a draft to compare/merge."
- Proceed with analysis to identify gaps or conflicts

### 2. Automated Pattern Discovery

Scan the codebase for patterns across these categories. For each, note:
- **Consistency**: What % of files follow this pattern?
- **Examples**: 2-3 specific file paths demonstrating the pattern
- **Confidence**: HIGH (>80% consistent), MEDIUM (50-80%), LOW (<50% or unclear)

#### A. Code Quality Patterns

| Pattern | Detection Method |
|---------|------------------|
| TypeScript strict mode | Check tsconfig.json for strict: true |
| ESLint/linting rules | Parse .eslintrc* for enabled rules |
| Formatting tools | Presence of .prettierrc, .editorconfig |
| Maximum file length | Analyze distribution of file sizes |
| Naming conventions | Analyze function/class/file naming patterns |
| Comment density | Ratio of comments to code |
| JSDoc/documentation | Presence of doc comments on exports |

#### B. Testing Patterns

| Pattern | Detection Method |
|---------|------------------|
| Test framework | Detect jest, vitest, mocha, pytest, etc. |
| Test file location | Co-located vs. separate test directory |
| Test file naming | *.test.ts, *.spec.ts, test_*.py patterns |
| Coverage configuration | Presence of coverage config, thresholds |
| Test types present | Unit, integration, e2e directories |

#### C. Security Patterns

| Pattern | Detection Method |
|---------|------------------|
| Secret management | Environment variable usage vs. hardcoded values |
| Input validation | Presence of validation libraries (Zod, Joi, etc.) |
| Auth patterns | Authentication library usage |
| SQL patterns | Parameterized queries vs. string concatenation |
| Dependency scanning | Security audit in package.json scripts |

#### D. Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | Detection Method |
|---------|------------------|
| Directory structure | Analyze folder organization |
| Layer separation | Presence of routes/, services/, models/ etc. |
| API patterns | REST conventions, GraphQL, tRPC usage |
| Database access | ORM usage (Prisma, TypeORM, SQLAlchemy) |
| Error handling | Custom error classes, try/catch patterns |

#### E. Observability Patterns

| Pattern | Detection Method |
|---------|------------------|
| Logging | Logger library usage, console.log presence |
| Structured logging | JSON logging patterns |
| Error tracking | Sentry, Rollbar, etc. integration |
| Health checks | /health or /healthz endpoints |

#### F. Workflow Patterns

| Pattern | Detection Method |
|---------|------------------|
| Git workflow | Branch naming in .git, protected branches |
| CI/CD | Presence of .github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml |
| Pre-commit hooks | .husky/, .pre-commit-config.yaml |
| Changelog maintenance | CHANGELOG.md updates |

### 3. Generate Discovery Report

Produce an internal discovery summary (shown to user before questions):

```markdown
## Codebase Analysis Summary

**Stack Detected**: [Language] + [Framework] + [Database]
**Files Analyzed**: [count] source files, [count] test files

### High-Confidence Patterns (>80% consistent)

| Pattern | Evidence | Recommendation |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| TypeScript strict mode | tsconfig.json strict: true | → MUST principle |
| Jest testing | All 47 test files use Jest | → MUST principle |
| Prisma ORM | No raw SQL found | → SHOULD principle |

### Medium-Confidence Patterns (50-80% consistent)

| Pattern | Evidence | Needs Decision |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| JSDoc on exports | 73% of exported functions | Formalize or relax? |
| Error classes | 60% use CustomError | Standardize pattern? |

### Inconsistent Areas (Needs Discussion)

| Area | Observation | Question |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Logging | Mixed console.log and winston | Which to standardize? |
| Test coverage | /api has tests, /utils doesn't | Coverage requirement? |

### Gaps Detected (No Clear Pattern)

- No input validation library detected
- No rate limiting implementation found
- No structured error response format
```

### 4. Interactive Question Loop

Based on discovery findings, generate targeted questions. Use the same interaction pattern as `/speckit.clarify`:

**Question Categories** (prioritized):

1. **Validation Questions**: Confirm high-confidence patterns should become MUST principles
2. **Decision Questions**: Resolve medium-confidence patterns (formalize or relax?)
3. **Gap Questions**: Determine if missing patterns should be added as requirements
4. **Priority Questions**: Which principles matter most to the team?

**Maximum Questions**: 8-10 total (more than clarify since this is foundational)

**Question Format**:

Present ONE question at a time with recommendation:

```markdown
## Question 1 of 8: Testing Standards

I found that **100% of test files use Jest** and tests are co-located with source files.

**Recommended:** Formalize as MUST principle

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | MUST: All code must have Jest tests in co-located *.test.ts files |
| B | SHOULD: Tests strongly encouraged but not blocking |
| C | No principle: Leave testing as informal convention |
| D | Different approach (describe in <=10 words) |

Reply with option letter, "yes"/"recommended" to accept, or your own answer.
```

**Question Sequencing**:

1. Start with high-confidence patterns (easy wins, builds momentum)
2. Move to decision points for medium-confidence patterns
3. Address critical gaps (security, testing if not covered)
4. Ask about priority/severity levels for borderline items
5. End with governance questions (how to handle amendments)

**Early Termination Signals**: "done", "enough", "that's good", "proceed"

### 5. Synthesize Draft Constitution

After questions complete (or user terminates early), generate a draft constitution:

```markdown
# [Project Name] Constitution (DRAFT)

> ⚠️ **DRAFT**: Generated by /speckit.discover-constitution on YYYY-MM-DD
> Review carefully before finalizing. Run /speckit.constitution to formalize.

## Discovery Context

- **Source**: Analyzed [X] files in [repository]
- **Patterns Found**: [Y] high-confidence, [Z] formalized via questions
- **Coverage**: [categories covered]

## Core Principles

### I. [Principle Name] (MANDATORY)

[Description based on discovered pattern + user confirmation]

- [Specific rule] (MUST)
- [Specific rule] (MUST)

**Evidence**: [Examples from codebase that demonstrate this pattern]

### II. [Principle Name]

[Description...]

## Governance

- Constitution amendments require [user input or default: team discussion]
- Reviews should occur [user input or default: quarterly]

**Version**: 0.1.0-draft | **Generated**: YYYY-MM-DD
```

### 6. Gap Analysis

After draft generation, identify what's NOT covered:

```markdown
## Principles NOT Included (Consider Adding)

Based on common best practices, these areas have no discovered pattern or explicit decision:

| Area | Common Principle | Why Consider |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| Input Validation | All user input MUST be validated | Security best practice |
| Rate Limiting | Public APIs SHOULD have rate limits | DDoS protection |
| Accessibility | UI SHOULD meet WCAG AA | Legal/ethical requirement |

Would you like to add any of these? (Reply with area names, or "none")
```

### 7. Output Draft and Next Steps

Write draft to `.specify/memory/constitution-draft.md` (not overwriting existing constitution if present).

```markdown
## Discovery Complete

**Draft saved to**: `.specify/memory/constitution-draft.md`

### Summary

- Questions asked: [X]
- Principles formalized: [Y]
- Categories covered: [list]
- Gaps identified: [Z]

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Review the draft**: Open `.specify/memory/constitution-draft.md` and refine wording
2. **Team discussion**: Share draft with team for feedback
3. **Finalize**: Run `/speckit.constitution` to create the official constitution
4. **Validate**: Run `/speckit.site-audit` to check codebase against new principles

### Comparison (if existing constitution found)

| Principle | Existing | Discovered | Conflict? |
|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

## Question Templates

### Pattern Validation Questions

```markdown
I found that **[pattern description]** with **[X]% consistency** across [Y] files.

Examples:
- `src/api/users.ts` - [specific example]
- `src/services/auth.ts` - [specific example]

**Recommended:** [MUST/SHOULD/No principle] - [brief reasoning]

Should this become a formal principle?
```

### Gap Questions

```markdown
I did **not find** a clear pattern for **[category]**.

Common approaches include:
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | [Approach 1] |
| B | [Approach 2] |
| C | Not needed for this project |

What's your preference?
```

### Priority Questions

```markdown
For **[principle]**, what severity should violations have?

| Option | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| A | **MUST** - Violations are blocking (CRITICAL in PR review) |
| B | **SHOULD** - Strongly recommended (HIGH in PR review) |
| C | **MAY** - Optional guideline (LOW in PR review) |
```

### Governance Questions

```markdown
How should constitution amendments be handled?

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Any team member can propose; requires team approval |
| B | Tech lead approval required |
| C | Documented but informal process |
| D | Other (describe briefly) |
```

## Edge Cases

### Empty/Minimal Codebase

If fewer than 10 source files found:
- Skip automated discovery
- Switch to aspirational mode: "What principles do you WANT to establish?"
- Provide common principle templates to choose from

### Highly Inconsistent Codebase

If no patterns reach >50% consistency:
- Report honestly: "No strong patterns detected—codebase may have evolved organically"
- Focus questions on: "What SHOULD the standard be going forward?"
- Recommend running site-audit after constitution to identify cleanup areas

### Existing Constitution Present

- Complete discovery anyway
- Compare discovered patterns vs. documented principles
- Highlight gaps and conflicts
- Suggest constitution updates if code has drifted

### User Skips All Questions

If user says "done" before any questions:
- Generate constitution from high-confidence patterns only
- Mark all medium/low patterns as "SUGGESTED" not MUST/SHOULD
- Strongly recommend reviewing draft
