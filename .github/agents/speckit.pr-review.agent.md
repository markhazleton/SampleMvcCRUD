## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Overview

This command reviews GitHub Pull Requests against the project constitution. It works for **any PR in the repository** regardless of feature branch or target branch. Reviews are stored in `/specs/pr-review/pr-{id}.md` for historical reference.

**IMPORTANT**: This command **only provides suggestions** - it does not make any code changes.

## Prerequisites

- Project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (REQUIRED)
- GitHub repository with PR context
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated (required)

## Outline

### 1. Initialize Review Context

Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/get-pr-context.ps1 $ARGUMENTS -Json` to extract PR context and parse JSON output for:
- `PR_CONTEXT`: PR metadata (number, title, branches, commit SHA, files, diff)
- `CONSTITUTION_PATH`: Path to constitution file
- `REVIEW_DIR`: Directory where review will be saved

**PR Number Detection**:
The script will try to determine PR number in this order:
1. User explicitly provides PR number in arguments: `#123` or `123`
2. GitHub environment variables: `GITHUB_PR_NUMBER`, `PR_NUMBER`
3. Current branch PR detection via `gh pr view`
4. If unable to detect, the script will error with clear instructions

**Error Handling**:
If the script fails:
- **Constitution missing**: Guide user to run `/speckit.constitution`
- **GitHub CLI not installed**: Provide installation instructions
- **PR not found**: Ask user to verify PR number and `gh auth status`
- **No PR number**: Ask user to provide PR number explicitly

For single quotes in args like "I'm reviewing", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m reviewing' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm reviewing").

### 2. Load Constitution

Read and parse `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:
- Extract all core principles with their names
- Identify MUST requirements (non-negotiable/mandatory)
- Identify SHOULD requirements (recommended)
- Note constitution version and amendment date
- Build a checklist of principles to evaluate

If constitution doesn't exist:
- **STOP** and inform user that constitution is required
- Provide guidance: "Run `/speckit.constitution` to create project principles first"
- Do not proceed with review

### 3. Analyze PR Changes

Using the PR_CONTEXT data from the script:

#### A. Review Changed Files
For each file in `files_changed`:
- Read the diff to understand what changed
- Identify the type of change (new file, modified, deleted)
- Note the scope of changes (lines added/removed)
- Extract code snippets for analysis

#### B. Examine PR Diff
Parse the full diff to:
- Identify new functionality added
- Check for removed functionality
- Look for modified behavior
- Note refactoring vs. feature changes

#### C. Review Commit Messages
- Check if commits follow conventions
- Identify the intent behind changes
- Look for breaking change indicators

### 4. Perform Constitution-Based Review

For **each principle** in the constitution:

#### A. Compliance Check
- Review changed files against this specific principle
- Determine if the PR violates, partially complies, or fully complies
- Collect specific evidence (file names, line numbers, code snippets)

#### B. Severity Classification
Based on the principle's importance and violation type:
- **CRITICAL**: Violates mandatory (MUST) principle - blocks merge
- **HIGH**: Violates recommended (SHOULD) principle significantly
- **MEDIUM**: Partial compliance, improvement opportunity
- **LOW**: Style suggestions or minor improvements

For each finding:
- Quote the specific code that demonstrates the issue
- Reference the exact constitution section violated
- Explain clearly why this is an issue
- Provide a specific, actionable recommendation

#### C. Generate Findings
Create structured findings with:
- **ID**: Unique identifier (C1, H1, M1, L1, etc.)
- **Principle**: Name of constitution principle
- **File:Line**: Exact location in code
- **Issue**: Specific description of the problem
- **Recommendation**: Concrete action to resolve

### 5. Additional Review Dimensions

#### Security Analysis
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: Scan for API keys, passwords, tokens in code
- **Input Validation**: Check if user inputs are validated
- **Authentication**: Review auth/authz changes for correctness
- **SQL Injection**: Look for unsafe database queries
- **XSS**: Check for unescaped output in web contexts
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Note if new dependencies added

Create checklist:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation present where needed
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checks appropriate
- [ ] No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] No XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependencies reviewed for vulnerabilities

#### Code Quality Assessment
If constitution has code quality principles:
- **Naming Conventions**: Verify names follow standards
- **Code Organization**: Check structure matches guidelines
- **Error Handling**: Review exception handling patterns
- **Duplication**: Identify code duplication issues
- **Complexity**: Note overly complex code

Identify:
- **Strengths**: What the PR does well
- **Areas for Improvement**: Specific suggestions

#### Testing Validation
If constitution has testing principles (e.g., TDD):
- Check if tests exist for new/modified code
- Verify test quality and coverage
- Confirm tests were written appropriately
- Review test naming and organization

#### Documentation Review
If constitution requires documentation:
- Check if README updated if needed
- Verify code comments for complex logic
- Confirm API documentation updated
- Check if CHANGELOG updated

### 6. Check for Feature Context (Optional)

Try to determine if this PR maps to a feature spec:
- Extract feature number from branch name pattern (e.g., `001-feature-name`)
- Check if `/specs/{feature}/spec.md` exists
- If spec exists, optionally cross-reference:
  - Does implementation match spec requirements?
  - Are acceptance criteria being addressed?
  - Is scope appropriate for the spec?

**Note**: This is optional - PR review works without any spec.

### 7. Generate Review Report

Create comprehensive report at `/specs/pr-review/pr-{PR_NUMBER}.md`:

#### Handle Existing Reviews
If file already exists:
1. Read the existing file
2. Extract the previous commit SHA from metadata
3. Compare with current commit SHA from PR_CONTEXT
4. **If commit SHA is the same**:
   - Replace the entire file with updated review
   - Keep the original review date, update "Last Updated" date
5. **If commit SHA is different (PR was updated)**:
   - Keep existing content
   - Insert new review at the top
   - Move previous review to "Previous Review History" section at bottom
   - Add clear separators between reviews

#### Report Structure

## Guidelines

### Constitution Authority

The constitution is **non-negotiable** and the **authoritative source** for all review criteria.

All findings must:
- Reference the specific constitution section (by principle name)
- Quote the exact constitution language (MUST/SHOULD/etc.)
- Explain how the code violates or complies with the principle
- Use the constitution's own terminology and standards

### Evidence-Based Feedback

Every issue must include:
- **Specific location**: File path and line number (not "multiple files" or "various places")
- **Code quote**: Actual code snippet showing the issue (2-5 lines of context)
- **Constitution reference**: Which principle is violated and why
- **Actionable recommendation**: Specific fix with example if possible

**Bad example**: "Code has issues with naming"  
**Good example**: "src/api.ts:45 - Variable `x` violates naming principle 'Use descriptive names'. Rename to `userApiKey`."

### Review Objectivity

- Focus on facts, not opinions or style preferences
- Base all feedback on constitution principles
- Avoid subjective language ("ugly code", "bad design")
- If not in constitution, don't flag it (or mark as LOW priority observation)

### Severity Guidelines

Use these criteria for classification:
- **CRITICAL**: Violates MUST principle, blocks functionality, security risk, breaks production
- **HIGH**: Violates SHOULD principle significantly, quality concerns, technical debt
- **MEDIUM**: Partial compliance, improvement opportunity, maintainability concern
- **LOW**: Style preference, minor optimization, optional enhancement

### Graceful Error Handling

**If constitution missing**:
```
❌ Cannot perform PR review - Constitution required

The project constitution defines the review criteria. Create one first:

1. Run: /speckit.constitution
2. Define your project's core principles
3. Then retry: /speckit.pr-review #{PR_NUMBER}

Learn more: https://github.com/MarkHazleton/spec-kit
```

**If PR not found**:
```
❌ PR #{NUMBER} not found

Troubleshooting:
1. Check the PR number is correct
2. Verify GitHub CLI authentication: gh auth status
3. Confirm you have repository access

If issue persists, provide PR number explicitly:
/speckit.pr-review #123
```

**If GitHub CLI not installed**:
```
❌ GitHub CLI (gh) required but not installed

Install GitHub CLI:
- macOS: brew install gh
- Windows: winget install --id GitHub.cli
- Linux: https://github.com/cli/cli#installation

After installation, authenticate:
gh auth login

Then retry: /speckit.pr-review
```

### Positive Feedback

If PR is excellent:
- Acknowledge good practices
- Call out strengths specifically
- Provide enthusiastic approval
- Example: "Excellent PR! Comprehensive tests, clear documentation, follows all constitution principles. Strong work! ✅"

### Review Updates

When re-reviewing an updated PR:
- Explicitly note what changed since last review
- Acknowledge fixed issues: "✅ Fixed: C1 (tests added)"
- Note new issues introduced: "⚠️ New: H3 (missing validation)"
- Compare commit SHAs and summarize delta
