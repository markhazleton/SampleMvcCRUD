## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Overview

This command facilitates constitution evolution by:

1. Analyzing PR review findings for recurring violation patterns
2. Detecting issues not mapped to existing principles
3. Generating draft amendment proposals (CAP - Constitution Amendment Proposal)
4. Tracking constitution change history
5. Managing the approval workflow

**IMPORTANT**: This command generates PROPOSALS only. Amendments must be explicitly approved before being applied via `/speckit.constitution`.

## Prerequisites

- Project constitution at `/.documentation.documentation/memory/constitution.md` (REQUIRED)
- PR review history in `/.documentation/specs/pr-review/` (recommended)
- Site audit history in `/.documentation/copilot/audit/` (optional)

## Actions

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for action type:

| Action | Trigger | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `analyze` | Default | Analyze reviews/audits and propose amendments |
| `suggest` | `/speckit.evolve-constitution suggest "..."` | Create proposal from manual suggestion |
| `approve` | `/speckit.evolve-constitution approve CAP-YYYY-NNN` | Approve a proposal |
| `reject` | `/speckit.evolve-constitution reject CAP-YYYY-NNN "reason"` | Reject a proposal |

## Outline

### 1. Initialize Evolution Context

Run `.documentation/scripts/powershell/evolution-context.ps1 $ARGUMENTS -Json` to gather context and parse JSON output for:

- `CONSTITUTION_PATH`: Path to current constitution
- `CONSTITUTION_EXISTS`: Whether constitution exists
- `CONSTITUTION_VERSION`: Current version
- `CONSTITUTION_PRINCIPLES`: List of existing principles
- `PR_REVIEW_DIR`: Path to PR review directory
- `PR_REVIEWS`: List of recent PR review files
- `PR_REVIEW_COUNT`: Total PR reviews available
- `AUDIT_DIR`: Path to audit directory
- `AUDIT_REPORTS`: List of recent audit reports
- `AUDIT_COUNT`: Total audits available
- `PROPOSALS_DIR`: Path to proposals directory
- `PROPOSALS`: List of existing proposals
- `NEXT_CAP_ID`: Next proposal ID
- `PATTERN_SUMMARY`: Aggregated violation patterns
- `CRITICAL_COUNT`: Count of critical findings
- `HIGH_COUNT`: Count of high-priority findings
- `ACTION`: Determined action
- `CAP_ID`: Proposal ID (for approve/reject)
- `SUGGESTION`: Manual suggestion text

**Error Handling:**

If constitution doesn't exist:

- **STOP** and inform user that constitution is required
- Provide guidance: "Run `/speckit.constitution` to create project principles first"

### 2. Handle Action

#### Action: `approve`

If ACTION is "approve" and CAP_ID is provided:

1. Read proposal from `PROPOSALS_DIR/CAP_ID.md`
2. If file doesn't exist: ERROR "Proposal {CAP_ID} not found"
3. Update proposal status to "APPROVED"
4. Update `/.documentation.documentation/memory/constitution-history.md`:
   - Add entry to Amendment Log
   - Record approval date
5. Output:

```markdown
Proposal Approved: {CAP_ID}

The amendment has been approved but NOT YET APPLIED.

To apply this amendment to the constitution:
/speckit.constitution

The constitution command will detect approved proposals and offer to apply them.
```

1. Stop execution

#### Action: `reject`

If ACTION is "reject" and CAP_ID is provided:

1. Read proposal from `PROPOSALS_DIR/CAP_ID.md`
2. If file doesn't exist: ERROR "Proposal {CAP_ID} not found"
3. Update proposal status to "REJECTED"
4. Add rejection reason from arguments
5. Move to `PROPOSALS_DIR/rejected/` subdirectory
6. Update history file with rejection record
7. Output:

```markdown
Proposal Rejected: {CAP_ID}

Reason: {rejection reason}

The proposal has been archived in:
/.documentation.documentation/memory/proposals/rejected/{CAP_ID}.md
```

1. Stop execution

#### Action: `suggest`

If ACTION is "suggest" and SUGGESTION is provided:

1. Skip pattern analysis
2. Go directly to step 5 (Proposal Generation)
3. Create proposal based on manual suggestion

#### Action: `analyze` (Default)

Continue to step 3 for full analysis.

### 3. Pattern Analysis

#### A. PR Review Analysis

Scan PR reviews in `PR_REVIEW_DIR`:

For each PR review file:

1. Extract all findings (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM)
2. Map findings to constitution principles
3. Track which principles have violations
4. Identify findings that don't map to any principle

**Build Pattern Summary:**

```markdown
| Principle | Violations | PRs Affected | Trend |
|-----------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Security | 15 | pr-45, pr-67, pr-89 | ↑ Increasing |
| Testing | 8 | pr-23, pr-56 | → Stable |
| (Uncategorized) | 5 | pr-12, pr-34 | New |
```

**Identify Uncategorized Issues:**

Issues not matching any existing principle:

- Missing error boundaries
- Inconsistent API versioning
- No accessibility considerations
- Hardcoded configuration values

#### B. Audit Analysis (if available)

Scan audit reports in `AUDIT_DIR`:

1. Extract compliance scores by category
2. Track score trends across audits
3. Identify persistent issues (appearing in 2+ audits)
4. Note categories with declining scores

#### C. Gap Detection

Compare findings against constitution:

| Finding | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Issues with no matching principle | **Potential new principle** |
| Principles with zero violations | Potentially redundant or well-followed |
| Principles with 5+ violations | May need clarification |
| New violation categories emerging | Evolution trigger |

### 4. Evolution Threshold Check

Generate proposals only when patterns meet thresholds:

| Trigger | Threshold | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Recurring violations | 3+ PRs with same issue | Propose clarification |
| Uncategorized issues | 3+ instances | Propose new principle |
| Critical findings | Any uncovered critical | High-priority proposal |
| Manual suggestion | Always | Create proposal |

If no patterns meet thresholds:

```markdown
## Evolution Analysis Complete

No constitution amendments recommended at this time.

**Analysis Summary:**
- PR Reviews Analyzed: {N}
- Audit Reports Analyzed: {M}
- Patterns Meeting Threshold: 0

**Current State:**
- Constitution compliance appears healthy
- No recurring uncategorized issues detected
- Existing principles cover observed patterns

**Recommendations:**
- Continue monitoring with regular PR reviews
- Run `/speckit.site-audit` for comprehensive compliance check
- Revisit evolution analysis after 10+ more PR reviews

To force a proposal from manual observation:
/speckit.evolve-constitution suggest "Your observed pattern or needed principle"
```

Stop execution if no proposals warranted.

### 5. Proposal Generation

For each identified evolution need, create proposal at `PROPOSALS_DIR/NEXT_CAP_ID.md`:

Ensure directory exists: Create `/.documentation.documentation/memory/proposals/` if missing.

```markdown
# Constitution Amendment Proposal: {NEXT_CAP_ID}

## Proposal Metadata

- **Proposal ID**: {NEXT_CAP_ID}
- **Created**: {TIMESTAMP}

## Guidelines

### Proposal Quality

Proposals should be:

- **Evidence-based**: Supported by PR/audit findings
- **Testable**: Can be verified in code review
- **Actionable**: Developers know how to comply
- **Justified**: Clear rationale with specific examples
- **Scoped**: Not overly broad or narrow

### Amendment Types

| Type | Use When | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| ADD | New area needs coverage | "API Versioning" principle |
| MODIFY | Existing principle unclear | Clarify testing requirements |
| DEPRECATE | Principle no longer relevant | Remove outdated standard |
| CLARIFY | Add examples only | Add code examples to existing |

### Voting Process

Default governance (can be customized in constitution):

- Review period: 14 days
- Approval: Majority of reviewers
- Veto: Any critical concern blocks until resolved

### Integration Points

**PR Review Integration:**

When PR review finds uncategorized issues:

```markdown
**Note**: This issue doesn't map to current constitution principles.
Consider running `/speckit.evolve-constitution` to propose amendments.
```

**Site Audit Integration:**

When audit finds patterns without principles:

```markdown
**Gap Detected**: {N} issues found without constitutional coverage.
Recommendation: Run `/speckit.evolve-constitution --scope=audit`
```

### Error Handling

**No PR Reviews Available:**

```markdown
Insufficient Data for Evolution Analysis

No PR reviews found in /.documentation/specs/pr-review/

To build analysis data:
1. Run `/speckit.pr-review` on recent PRs
2. Accumulate 5+ reviews for meaningful patterns
3. Retry `/speckit.evolve-constitution`

Or create manual proposal:
/speckit.evolve-constitution suggest "Your observed pattern"
```

**No Constitution:**

```markdown
Cannot perform evolution analysis - Constitution required

Create a constitution first:
1. Run: /speckit.constitution
2. Define your project's core principles
3. Run PR reviews to build compliance data
4. Then retry: /speckit.evolve-constitution
```
